# AI Coding Assistant Antipatterns

Common problematic patterns to watch for when working with AI coding assistants, and practical strategies to address them.

## Quick Reference Guide

1. **[Premature Architecture Complexity](premature-architecture.md)** - Creating overly complex architectures before requirements are clear

2. **[Test-Driven Design Misapplication](test-driven-design.md)** - Following test patterns blindly instead of designing from first principles

3. **[Purpose Drift During Refactoring](purpose-drift.md)** - Losing sight of original goals during continuous refactoring

4. **[Library and Framework Reinvention](library-reinvention.md)** - Reimplementing functionality already available in established libraries

5. **[Failure to Separate Concerns](separation-of-concerns.md)** - Mixing different responsibilities within the same components

## General Strategies

When working with AI coding assistants:

While each antipattern has specific remediation approaches, several general strategies apply across all patterns:

1. **Start with clear requirements and constraints**
   - Be explicit about what is needed and what isn't
   - Define scope boundaries before discussing architecture

2. **Focus on incremental development**
   - Begin with minimal solutions and build up as needed
   - Validate each step before adding complexity

3. **Establish regular check-in points**
   - Reconnect to original goals frequently
   - Verify that current direction aligns with requirements

4. **Challenge complexity**
   - Ask for justification of complex components
   - Request simpler alternatives when appropriate

5. **Leverage existing tools**
   - Start with available libraries and frameworks
   - Question custom implementations of solved problems

## How to Use These Guides

- Reference a specific antipattern when you detect it
- Apply the suggested interventions to redirect the AI assistant
- Use the preventive measures when starting new projects
- Add your own observations and successful strategies
