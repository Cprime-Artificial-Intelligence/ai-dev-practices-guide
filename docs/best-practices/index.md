# Best Practices for AI-Assisted Coding

This section provides guidelines and patterns for effective collaboration with AI coding assistants. These best practices will help you maintain code quality, manage complexity, and implement robust solutions when working with AI tools. If you find a best practice that works for you, please consider starting a discussion or starting a pull request to add it to this guide.

## General Principles

When working with AI coding assistants, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Maintain control over architecture decisions**
   - Use AI for implementation details, not high-level design
   - Validate architectural suggestions against established patterns

2. **Verify generated code quality**
   - Review all AI-generated code for complexity issues
   - Apply consistent standards to both human and AI-written code

3. **Incremental adoption**
   - Integrate smaller, well-understood chunks of AI-generated code
   - Build up complexity gradually rather than all at once

4. **Continuous learning**
   - Document successful patterns for future reference
   - Share effective prompting techniques with your team

5. **Balance automation with oversight**
   - Automate routine coding tasks with AI
   - Maintain human oversight for critical components
