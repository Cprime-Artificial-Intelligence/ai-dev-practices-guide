# AI Coding Agent Practices

Welcome to the AI Coding Agent Practices documentation. This site provides guidance on common antipatterns and best practices when working with AI coding assistants.

## What You'll Find Here

This documentation is organized into three main sections:
### [Overview](overview/index.md)

An overview of the problem space and the foundational thinking that promoted the set of practical strategies contained herein.

### [Antipatterns](antipatterns/index.md)

Common problematic patterns to watch for when working with AI coding assistants, and practical strategies to address them:

- [Premature Architecture Complexity](antipatterns/premature-architecture.md)
- [Test-Driven Design Misapplication](antipatterns/test-driven-design.md)
- [Purpose Drift During Refactoring](antipatterns/purpose-drift.md)
- [Library and Framework Reinvention](antipatterns/library-reinvention.md)
- [Failure to Separate Concerns](antipatterns/separation-of-concerns.md)

### [Best Practices](best-practices/index.md)

Guidelines and patterns for effective AI-assisted coding:

- [Managing Code Complexity](best-practices/cyclomatic-complexity.md)
- [Factory Pattern Implementation](best-practices/factory-pattern.md)

## Getting Started

If you're new to working with AI coding assistants, we recommend starting with the [Antipatterns Overview](antipatterns/index.md) to understand common pitfalls, followed by the best practices section to learn effective strategies for AI collaboration.
