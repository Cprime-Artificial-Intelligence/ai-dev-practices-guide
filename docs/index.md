# AI Coding Agent Practices

Welcome to the AI Coding Agent Practices documentation. This site provides guidance systems thinking, common antipatterns, and best practices when working with AI coding assistants.

## What You'll Find Here

This documentation is organized into three main sections:
### [Overview and Background](overview/index.md)

An overview of the problem space and the foundational thinking that promoted the set of practical strategies contained herein.

### [Antipatterns](antipatterns/index.md)

Common problematic patterns to watch for when working with AI coding assistants, and practical strategies to address them:

### [Best Practices](best-practices/index.md)

Guidelines and patterns for effective AI-assisted coding:

## Getting Started

If you're new to working with AI coding assistants, we recommend starting with the [Antipatterns Overview](antipatterns/index.md) to understand common pitfalls, followed by the best practices section to learn effective strategies for AI collaboration.

Next, you might consider the [Systems Thinking for AI Collaboration](overview/systems-thinking-governance.md) for an introduction to the larger picture - what it means to introduce AI agents with humans, and to consider the self regulation of complex systems.
